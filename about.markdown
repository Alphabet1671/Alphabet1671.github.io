# About this site
Hey, glad that you've stumbled upon this site. This series of blog posts are to document all my work that is FSAE related. Whether it's projects that I've done as a part of a certain no-name team or just quick thoughts that I've had that I deemed worthy of researching, they're posted here.

The past few years of FSAE is when I grew the most as an engineer. From knowing nothing better than to 3D-print something and just see if they work all the way to independently designing an entire cooling system with quantitative analysis using validated models, I'm grateful that I worked with so many that not only taught me all I knew, but also how to think like a real engineer. I sincerely hope that you find what I put here helpful, or at least interesting. Of course, everything on here is what a race car engineer wannabe managed to figure out as an undergrad student, so maybe take all of this with a grain of salt.
