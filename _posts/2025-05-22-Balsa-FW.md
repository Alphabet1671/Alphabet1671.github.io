# Preliminary Trade Study

This is to see if there's any potential of this new design being lighter and better than the actual front wing. The wing rn weighs in at about 7lbm which is 3.17kg

Below is the preliminary CAD of the balsa structures, it's super giga omega conservative:

![image of a front wing frame](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/1.png)

Here's volume in normal ppl unit:
![image of a front wing frame in normal people unit](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/2.png)

Balsa comes in all kinds of densities and grains, which will be taken into account later, but for this very basic trade an average weight of 150kg/m^3 is used:
[Source](https://www.wood-database.com/balsa/)

So the mass of this example frame is going to be:
$0.001405554 \times 150 = 0.2108331kg$

This just really seems too good to be true, so maybe this frame is not as conservative as I thought it's gonna be?

The next step would be to analyze material properties to see what a more realistic frame would look like. But it's good to get an extrema value here, so let's assume the entirety of the main plane is filled with balsa:

![solid front wing](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/3.png)

$0.00200176 \times 150 = 0.300264kg$

This just seems straight up crazy to me, how about worst case with the highest density balsa?
[This site](https://www.modelaviation.com/balsa) states that the hardest balsa is around 14lbm per cubic ft, so let's see how heavy it is to machine the entire thing out of balsa:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/4.png)

$0.0706913 * 14 = 0.9896782 lbm = 0.4486kg$

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/5.png)

I was wondering if the scale is off in CFD CAD but I'd be damned.

To get a better reference I weighed only the main plane as is:

![stupid carbon front wing weighing 1.7kg](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/6.png)

So it doesn't seem all that crazy after all, I'd be competing with 1.7kg, which seems not hard to beat at all. Even if by mass it's worse by a little bit, it's justifiable by virtue of it being a lot better aerodynamically.

# Balsa Properties

Most of the study here is extracted from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167663615000216)
This paper provided an empirical relationship between the orthotripic properties of balsa and its density in this graph: 

![a graph](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/7.png)

It's worth noting that due to the lower height of the specimen, the failure mode is tensile failure of the bottom part of the beam, which is assumed to be different from if a beam is taller than it is wide. In that case, I predict the failure mode to be some sort of buckling? Unsure and need more material testing to figure out.

For now, initial sizing can be done by using the pure bending data to get it in the ball park.

Assuming that the front wing is a straight beam with even load across the length and is rigidly supported at the strut but not the end plate (no tension cable, absolute worst case), it's easy to derive required bending MoI as a function of density: $\sigma = \frac{Mc}{I}$

Assume the max distance to be 1/2 of the max height of the rib: 

![rib thickness measurement](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/8.png)

$c = 0.03867/2 = 0.01934m$

Bending moment with maximum aero load + inertial load & no tension cable is calculated from max downforce, assuming that it's evenly distributed across all outer surfaces.

Each strut takes:

$739.238/2 = 369.619 N$

So maximum bending moment (at end plate) is : $369.19 * 0.4444 = 164.068 Nm
$

Plugging it into a matlab script plotting required MoI to not rapture with 1 FoS:

![maltab graph](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/9.png)

Checking this against the 4 spar design, the total MoI is:

![hehe](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/10.png)

$$
1/12*0.00953244*0.0195139^3 = 1.0E-8 \\
1/12*0.00953244*0.0386723^3 = 5.0E-8 \\
1/12*0.00953244*0.0291543^3 = 2.0E-8 \\
1/12*0.00953244*0.00699872^3 = 0.0 
$$

This is a pretty bad estimation since it assumes all of them are co-planar, but the sum of all of them is about 8e-8, which is about the same as what would be required for 250kg/m^3 balsa.

It's completely possible that balsa alone is enough to suffice. One thing to note here is that at the sweep section, fibers are somewhat loaded in peel, which can result in significant local weakness. Whether it is going to be a serious issue or not remains to be seen, but if it does become a problem in the 3 point bend test, a potential solution might be to bond a piece of thin aluminum sheet over the sides of the wood to reinforce it. Most literature found online have balsa composites the same way the 2024 monocoque hardpoints are made, which has fiber running normal to the face sheets. This is quite different from what's being proposed here, so the effectiveness of this idea needs to be validated still by more component testing. 

# Some Rag Tag Component Testing
In order to both gain further understanding of balsa in bending and validate the material that we currently have access to, it's important to conduct sample testing. Since the front wing mainly sees bending load, the most characteristic test would be a 3 point bend test.

This jig is manufactured so that any of the milling machines can be turned into an arbor press:
![jig](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/11.png)
The two cylinders sitting on top of V-grooved blocks are supports and 
4 sample pieces were purchased from a local Hobby Lobby, with density properties noted below:
$$
1\times3\times12" , 212kg/m^3\\
1\times3\times12", 131kg/m^3\\
2\times 3/16" sheets, 96 - 105kg/m^3
$$
Which enables us to study the strength of balsa under different densities and compare this to the data provided in the paper mentioned the balsa properties page.

So the first batch of test to be conducted would be the to cut the slabs into 3 different widths for testing, using the full length of the slabs. 

The widths are: 1cm, 2cm, and 3cm. 
The beams are loaded to destruction, and deformation is shown with a dial indicator. The dial indicator and scale are recorded within the same frame for a stress-strain curve.

Comparing the rupture modulus from our testing to the modulus in the paper:
Bending stress is calculated by:
$\sigma_f = \frac{3FL}{2bd^2}$
Which gives rupture modulus of $28.3MPa$. Putting the measured density of $212kg/m^3$ into the regression from the paper mentioned in the previous pages gives: 
$0.2157*212-13.007 = 32.7214$
Which is a 
$ 1-(32.7214/28.3) = 15.62\% $ difference.

Although it's hand-wavey to say this now, I think I trust the balsa strength to density relationship to be used as is with a 1.6x safety factor. With not many days until comp, I think the data in the paper is safe enough to be used so long as the wing was proof loaded.

# Covering Material Study

So aside from the model aircraft heat shrink wrap which might be not good for rock penetration and other stuff, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_fabric_covering) covering aircraft covering mentions Darcon/Ceonite as fabric, but one problem is stretching it over the frame and somehow making it wrinkle free.
Soon, I found out that Ceconite is heat shrink through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiUbFR21-6s).

Doing some elementary math allows me to figure out which of thess materials are lighter.

Ceconite: $3.4oz/yd = 3.4\times33.9 = 115.26g/m^2$
Superflite: $2.7\times33.9 = 91.53 g/m^2$

And for reference R/C aircraft shrinkwrap: $1.25*33.9 = 42.375g/m^2$

For the amount of wing we have to cover:
![wing area](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/12.png)
It's just $115.26\times0.785 = 90.4791g$ which again astonishes me. I ended up chosing Ceconite 101 because our of the two that's in stock (Ceconite and R/C covering) it holds up against rocks a lot better. 

The funny side effects is that this fabric is stamped with "FAA Approved", so had we not wrapped the front wing with livery, we definitely could've made a joke out of it at comp. 

## Mounting Check
As it currently is with the composite front wing, it's obvious that it's not mounted the same way that CAD shows it is. So it's necessary to investigate how off each feature is from the monocoque holes all the way to the tabs on the main plane to get an idea of the actual mounting solution.

The lateral placement of front wing is crucial since it's designed to pretty much maximize aero bounding box. Since monocoque this year is not a very good positional reference, it's necessary to find another way to figure this out. 
The longitudinal placement matters less because the tabs are going to be match drilled, so there's margin. Same goes for the vertical placement, but the key difference here being that ground height is crucial for aerodynamic performance and ground clearance. 

Starting with the monocoque holes:
![measruement](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/13.png)
![meassurement](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/14.png)

compared to the same measurements in CAD:

![measurement](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/15.png)

![measurement](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/16.png)

$15.7",15.5"$ vs. $16.0",15.72"$
Which is slightly less than ideal, but still not unfixable with just some washers or turned bushings. 

After fixing the front wing bending issue:
![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/17.png)
![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/18.png)

$14.95"$ vs $14.97"$, very nice.
So the front wing strut is accurate to CAD despite the monocoque being a little off, which is acceptable because the mounting points are close together near the front of the strut. 

## 2nd Pass Analysis
Starting with loads:
From the Cp graph, it's apparent that the pressure of front wing is relatively constant across its area, so it's plausible to assume even distribution.

The front wing main plane is then modeled as three sections: center, left and right. Each being a rectangle with representative area. Since the cascade load is borne by the end plates and the struts, it's reasonable to model all of them as point force with magnitude corresponding to their area. Per simple moment balance, half of the forces of the remaining cascade act on the end plate. 

The full wetted area of the front wing is $0.7089m^2$

Front wing main plane outboard rectangle: $0.1191/0.7089 = 0.168 * 2 = 0.336$

Main plane inboard section: $0.1486/0.7089 = 0.2096$

All cascade: $1 - 0.2096 - 0.336 = 0.4544$

According to CFD, the front wing makes 773N of downforce and 
132N of drag at max speed of 90mph, splitting it up by component gives:

|   |Lift(N)|Drag(N)|
|---|-------|-------|
|Main outboard (one side)|$773\times0.168 = 129.864 $|$132\times0.168 = 22.176 $|
|Main inboard|$773\times0.2096=162.0208$|$132\times0.2096 = 27.6672$|
|Others|$774\times0.4544 = 351.7056 $|$132\times0.4544 = 59.9808 $|

The paper mentioned earlier gives orthotropic properties of balsa wood:
![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/19.png)

The wing is modeled in CAD

Putting this into a new Ansys orthotropic material and running the simulation gives:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/20.png)

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/21.png)

Estimating the mass of this design assuming density of 300 gives:
$(0.00186221-0.000180624) \times 300 = 0.50447kg$

I tried 0.375" balsa and 0.5" thick balsa, both are outrageous in terms of stress. Need one aluminum spar:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/23.png)

Now the architecture of this wing is determined to be 0.5" thick spars and 1/4" 6061 for the mounting ribs and the main spar beacuse we have some at hand. Note how the main spar is pushed rearward of the centroid, this is to get it closer to the center of presssure of the entire cascade to further optimize for loading. It's an intuitive decision. 

# Finalized Design
The adhesive of choice will be Locktite EA-120HP as it is available without ordering more. 
The joint shear strength is given on the data sheet:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/24.png)

Which is almost as high as the radial tensile strength of balsa.

Since the balsa purchased is not long enough to stretch the entire span of the front wing, joints would be needed and a good place to do it would be at the mounting ribs because load needs to be efficiently transferred to the mounting tabs through those already which necessitates some sort of joint.

A few ideas come to mind:

- Direct epoxy bond
    - Kinda stupid, very little bond area, relying on a good bond to carry the load
    - Easy to make tho
- Notch on side
    - Need mating feature on the mounting ribs, kinda cancer to make
- L bracket
    - Already have stock?
    - Bond carbon L piece in addition to a direct bond
    - Sized w/o direct bond?
- Notch on top of two pieces connected by bonded face sheet
    - Basically join two pieces of wood together with thin alu or carbon sheet, and then notch from bottom to interface with the rib with a notch from the top
    - Might be better as bending moment doesn't have to be locally resolved at the interface

In addition to interfacing with the center rib, it also needs to interface with the other balsa ribs too, the notch from the top and bottom seem like they would work rather well here since that both locates the ribs for an accurate airfoil profile and serves as a joint. The trad off here is that, again, the strength of the spar is sacrificed since it's balsa is axially much stronger than an optimal bond. 

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/25.png)
FEA very blue, here's the setup:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/26.png)
Before you say it, yes I know it's not very realistic to apply a distributed load directly at the top and bottom surfaces of the frame, realistically there's all kinds of complex interactions going on. As much as it makes me cringe as an engineer to say this, I'm going to proof load it later so it's okay.

In reality we run tesion cables:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/27.png)

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/28.png)

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/29.png)

Cool, it's reduced to $280MPa$ with tension cable. Looks like some sort of cross bracing between the mounting ribs and the spar is inevitable. 
After examining ESPL stock options, there are two giant sheets of 0.200 thickness 6061. Seeing how the majority of the spar is not super stressed, it is plausible to go to 0.200 for the spar with added triangular support between the spar and mounting ribs still at 0.250. 

Let's see the preliminary weight:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/30.png)

$0.00271833\times300 = 0.815499kg$
$0.000251974\times2700 = 0.6803298kg$

$0.8155+0.6803 = 1.4958$ which is still lighter than the current $1.7kg$

At this point in design we discovered that the team just blew through all the stock that we thought we had for this project, so new stock thicknesses because we don't have time to wait for any order. 0.280" and 0.200".

Throwing that at the FEA solver:

![alt text](/images/posts/2025-05-22-Balsa-FW/31.png)

I wonder if changing the cable attachment point gets rid of some of this torsion?
And sure it did, much lower torsion

Finalized design and maximum stress at a $1.6\times$ load multiplier:
